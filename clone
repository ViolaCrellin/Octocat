Explain what git clone does, in your own words.

It's playing god. Nah, I'm kidding. 

Clone enables you to copy an entire repository, probably somebody elses' or a member of your teams' from a certain location. You now have a sort of mystical link to this person's file.

The command is:
git clone [location of what you're cloning]

It actually does all these commands in one go:
mkdir clone-file
cd clone-file
git init
git remote add origin [location of what you're cloning]
git pul
cd ..

Yeh, pretty nifty.
